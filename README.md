10 Minutes Steadfast
--------

**Assalamu'alaikum brothers and sisters, peace be upon you!**

How many times do you feel your smart phone has become like drugs to you?<br />
When you keep watching YouTube until midnight so you can not wake up at fajr on time?<br />
When you delay to go to a mosque when adzan calling and suddenly you realize it's already too late?<br />
Or even worse, it may leads you to fall into sin.<br />

Those are things that motivate me to create this app.
My idea is simple, create an app that can *force* me to stay away from my phone when I have an important task to do.
So when our smart phone becomes a ***fitna phone***, this little application may help us to fight it.

    May Allah Azza wa Jal make us easy to stay steadfast
    May He the Most Merciful forgive all of our sin
    Aameen

**NOTES:** <br />
PlayProtect may prompt a warning message when you installing this application.
This is a false alarm, you can safely continue the installation process.
I am not publish it to Playstore because they will not allow the use of Device Admin API which is required in this app.
Anyway, you can always build the APK yourself :)<br /><br />

**That's it! May this app ease your day to be a muslim**
